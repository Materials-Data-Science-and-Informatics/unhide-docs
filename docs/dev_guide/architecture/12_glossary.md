:::{admonition} Arc42 Information
:class: note, dropdown
**Contents**

The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use
when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in
multi-language teams.

**Motivation**

You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

-   have an identical understanding of these terms

-   do not use synonyms and homonyms

**Form**

See [Glossary](https://docs.arc42.org/section-12/) in the arc42
documentation.
