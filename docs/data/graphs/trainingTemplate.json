"description": "Sponsored by Helmholtz Information & Data Science Academy (HIDA)in cooperation with 
Core Facility Statistical Consulting at Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen - German Research Center for 
Environmental Health (Helmholtz Munich) is a fantastic tool to efficiently 
write manuscripts and research reports. It relieves the work of making your manuscripts and reports 
reproducible and transferable. You combine the coding in R and the writing of the documentation/interpretation 
of the results all in the same file and compile it directly as a report (e.g. as html, pdf or word document) 
After this course, you will no longer need to create multiple files in order to produce one single 
research document. Tables, figures, citations and much more can be included in one single document 
to be directly shared with your peers or PIs.Prerequisites: Programming skills with R, e.g. course 
'Introduction to R' More details here. Course Days and TimesMay 25, 2023, 9 am - 12:30 pm May 26, 2023, 
9 am - 12:30 pm NOTE: Registration will open 4 weeks before the course's starting date.",
