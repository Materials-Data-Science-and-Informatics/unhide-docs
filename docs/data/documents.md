# Documents


Metadata template for Documents, which is a combined category from the schema.org terms:
[CreativeWork](https://schema.org/CreativeWork), [DigitalDocument](https://schema.org/DigitalDocument), [Thesis](https://schema.org/Thesis), [Report](https://schema.org/Report), [Article](https://schema.org/Article), ...

So this all entries of these types will end up in the 'Document' search bucket.


Be aware that this category may contain also entries which are in reality no documents but typed in the metadata 
by the high level schema.org class 'CreateWork'.
