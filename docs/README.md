This folder contains the all files of the documentation pages. 
They are created using jupyter-book and hasted with gitlab pages (example see https://gitlab.com/pages/jupyterbook).


Therefore, you can build the docs with:
```
jupyter-book build docs
```

Also ideally the terms should go somewhere else and be automatically included in this.
The same goes for code documentation of the pipelines and their usage.
